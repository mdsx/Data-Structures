# C++ Data Structures Files

This file contains folders associated with programming assignments completed for a C++ Data Structures course taken at Foothill College.  The class was taught by Professor Michael Loceff in the Spring 2015 quarter.

Projects cover the main topics  of ADTs:
  - lists, vectors, sparse matrices
  - time complexity of algorithms
  - trees: general, binary search tree, AVL tree, splay tree
  - hashing tables, queues
  - implementations of quick sort among other sorting algorithms (and searching algorithms)
  - graphs: implemented using STL maps & sets; programs solve problems such as shortest path, minimum spanning tree, maximum flow, etc.

Some projects involve analysis of ADT's & algorithms -- they include wirte-ups which can be found in the comments below the main() of the client file for a given assignment.
